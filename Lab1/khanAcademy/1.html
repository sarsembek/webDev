        <h1>Lullaby</h1>
        <p>Nights I couldnâ€™t sleep<br>
    my mother sang to me<br>
    about a boy who wanted<br>
    to be flown into heaven.<br><br>

    Everyday, climbing up<br>
    the tower he lived in<br>
    to see the blue doves<br>
    flying by, and everyday,<br><br>

    climbing down, weeping<br>
    into a featherless sky.<br>
    Sometimes I think of<br>
    what it was like for him,<br><br>

    wingless, after the song:<br>
    his second life repeating<br>
    in the otherworld where<br>
    music waits to be sung.</p>
